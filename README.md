<h1>Banner Cycle</h1>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p>Banner cycle loops through a list of elements and rotates the ones to be shown and hidden. It is cross browser - <strong>even ie6:|</strong></p>
<p>It accepts an integer, checks it against the length of the elements and then applies the relevant classes to the ones that need to be hidden. We then loop through the list of elements, cloning the first one and then removing it and appending it to the end.</p>
<p>It's made visually cuter by jQuery:)</p>
<h2>What the hell is next?</h2>
<p>I'm going to make this into a jQuery plugin.</p>
<p><i>Thanks:)</i></p>
